# Cableway-Arduino

The following project concerns a team work for the university subject of Control Systems

Cableway created thanks to the use of the components:
-Arduino UNO
-RFID (RC522)
-IR sensor
-ON/OFF button
-Stepper motor 28byj-48

My role, together with my teammates, was to operate both on the hardware and software side
